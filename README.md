# Maze Generation and Solving

This project focuses on visualizing different Maze Generation and Maze solving techniques. 

Currently we generate the maze using the following algorithms
1. Randomized depth-first search

We can solve the maze using
1. Dijkstra algorithm
2. A* algorithm

To get started, install the packages and generate a production build

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

Then visit index.html in any browser. You don't need a server to run this project.
